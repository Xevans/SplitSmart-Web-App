# SplitSmart
 Web App for sending money and splitting bills with friends (Django framework)

 Accumulated from an older class project where I made several contributions beyond the scope of the project and its timeline for learning purposes. 
 Served as my first time using and learning the framework.
 Not planning to continue to add features to the project, but wrather reference and improve upon previous methods and approaches.

 Current Features
 User registration, authentication, profile management
 balance management
 send/request money
 notification stack
 bill splitting
 balance tracking
